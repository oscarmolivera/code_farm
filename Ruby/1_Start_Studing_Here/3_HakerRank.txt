1)Repeated String
here is a string, 'S', of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, 'n',
find and print the number of letter a's in the first 'n' letters of the infinite string.
Example
s = 'abcac'
n = 10
The substring we consider is 'abcacabcac', the first 10 characters of the infinite string. There are 4occurrences 
of a in the substring.

Function Description
Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below. repeatedString has the following parameter(s):

    * s: a string to repeat
    * n: the number of characters to consider

Returns

    * int: the frequency of a in the substring

Input Format
The first line contains a single string, 's'.
The second line contains an integer, 'n'.

Constraints
* 1 <= |s| <= 100
* 1 <= |n| <= 10^12
* For 25% of the cases n <= 10^6

Samples
Input 0		  Output 0
```					```
aba 				7
10
```
Explanation 0
The first n = 10 letters of the infinite string are abaabaabaa. Because there are 7 a's, we return .

Input 1		    Output 1
```					  ```
a 				    1000000000000
1000000000000
```
Explanation 1
Because all of the first n = 1000000000000 letters of the infinite string are a, we return 1000000000000.

1) New Year Chaos
t is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears 
a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue. Initial positions increment by 1 from 1 at 
the front of the line to n at the back. Any person in the queue can bribe the person directly in front 
of them to swap positions. If two people swap positions, they still wear the same sticker denoting 
their original places in line. One person can bribe at most two others. For example, if and bribes , 
the queue will look like this:

.

Fascinated by this chaotic queue, you decide you must know the minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state. If anyone has bribed more than two people, the line is too chaotic to compute the answer.
